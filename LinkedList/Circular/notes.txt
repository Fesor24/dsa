A variation of singly linked list
The difference btw it and singly linked list is that while in the former, the last node stores the 
address of the head node, in the latter, it doesn't.

Doubly Circular Linked List
A variation of doubly linked list
* The next pointer of the last node points to the head node
* The head node also has a pointer to the last node
