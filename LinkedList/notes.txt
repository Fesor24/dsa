Linear data structure
It is of dynamic size
Data can be inserted/deleted at any place
Insertion and deletion is easier than array
Accessing element O(n) while for array as we know is o(1)

Solves the drawback of array, which could lead to wastage of memory since arrays are of fixed size
With linked list, we do need to specify number of elements

A drawback, can be argued against Linked List is the allocation of storage for the pointer to the next node



Linked list is a collection of elements. 
Difference between it and array is that data is not stored in contiguous location
