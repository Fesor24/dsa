In singly linked list, each node contains two part:
1. Data part
2. Address part - The address of the next node

The address of the first node is stored in a pointer called the 'Head'. 
This is not the head node as it only stores the pointer for the head node.

It has only a single link, hence the name 'singly linked list'
Just a single link...
2|200 => 5|400 => 7|null

The list can not be traversed in the reverse direction
Only forward sequential movement is possible
