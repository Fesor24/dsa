Iterates from the first item to the last
If item exists, it returns the index
Otherwise it returns -1

Simplest search algorithm
It checks every element of the array one by one until the desired element is found or the end of the array is reached

How it works:
- Start from the first element of the array
- Compare each element to the target value
- If a match is found, return the index
- if the loop ends and no match is found, return -1

Time complexity
Best case - O(1)
Worst case - O(n)
Average case - O(n)

Space complexity
O(1): no extra space needed..no new data structures (arrays, list etc) are created.
We use a constant amount of extra memory, no matter how big the input array is
If we created an array or list to store the result, that would be O(n) space

Not ideal for large datasets
