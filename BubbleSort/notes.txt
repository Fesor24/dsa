Almost never used bcos of performance
Bad algorithm
In-place algorithm: uses a small amount of memory (doesn't depend on n)
Amount of space needed to solve the problem will not depend on the input size
O(n2) time complexity (quadratic)

Illustration
Given an array [1,4,7,9,2,0]
First iteration [1,4,7,2,0,9]
Second [1,4,2,0,7,9]
Third [1,2,0,4,7,9]
Fourth [1,0,2,4,7,9]
Fifth [0,1,2,4,7,9]
