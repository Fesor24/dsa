The array is divided in 2 parts; sorted sublist, unsorted sublist
We take one variable from the unsorted sublist and insert in the sorted sublist

Simply
First we pick an item from the unsorted sublist
Second we find the appropriate place for it in the sorted sublist

The first variable is considered as the sorted sublist and from index 1 to end, it is considered as unsorted

Two loops:
The first one from the unsorted sublist to end (The outer loop)
[0,9,4,2,7] i.e from index 1(value 9) to end

The second decremented...from the last item in the sorted sublist


// The outer loop...the unsorted sublist
// myArr[0] is considered the sorted sublist
// [9,2,9,0]
for(int i = 1; i < myArr.Length; i++)
{
    int temp = myArr[i]; // temp is 2
    int j = i - 1; // j is 0
    
    while(j >= 0 && myArr[j] > temp) 9 > 2
    {
        myArr[j + 1] = myArr[j];
        j--
    }
    
    myArr[j] = temp;
}
